# SteamSharp

SteamSharp is a portable class library for use in .NET 4.5+ projects. Due to its portability, this library can be used in Windows Store (8 or higher) and Windows Phone (8 or higher) applications (among others).

## Using Unit Test Framework

SteamSharp uses the built in Visual Studio Unit Test Framework. To run, open your Test Explorer from the Test menu --> Windows --> Test Explorer.

## Notable Packages

* Much of the Rest access layer (including portions of the Client, Request, and Response components) is either forked from or inspired by [RestSharp](https://github.com/restsharp/RestSharp)
* SteamSharp uses [NewtonSoft's Json.NET](https://github.com/JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json) for JSON deserialization
