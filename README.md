# DEPRECATED

Please note that SteamSharp is no longer under active development. If you are interested in taking over the project please feel free to shoot me a message to discuss.

# SteamSharp

SteamSharp is a portable class library for use in .NET 4.5+ projects. Due to its portability, this library can be used in Windows Store applications (8, 8.1, or UWP), Silverlight projects, and .NET projects (4.5.1+).

## Using Unit Test Framework

SteamSharp uses the built in Visual Studio Unit Test Framework. To run, open your Test Explorer from the Test menu --> Windows --> Test Explorer.

## Notable Packages

* Much of the Rest access layer (including portions of the Client, Request, and Response components) is either forked from or inspired by [RestSharp](https://github.com/restsharp/RestSharp)
* SteamSharp uses [NewtonSoft's Json.NET](https://github.com/JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json) for JSON deserialization
